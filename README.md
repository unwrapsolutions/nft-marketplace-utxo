# UTXO-Based NFT Marketplace for Micro-Communities

This project is an open source NFT marketplace built on Cardano’s extended UTXO model. It aims to serve local creators, artists, and small communities by offering a low-cost, fully decentralized platform to mint, list, and trade NFTs.

## 🌍 Project Purpose

Many existing NFT platforms are too expensive, complex, or centralized for everyday creators. This project makes it easier and more affordable for anyone to participate in the NFT economy using Cardano.

## ✨ Features

- Fully decentralized: no custodial control
- On-chain metadata (CIP-68)
- Wallet support (Lace, Eternl, Flint)
- Batch minting and trading
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Open source and community-driven

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Smart Contracts: Aiken / Plutus V2
- Frontend: SvelteKit
- Backend: Node.js + PostgreSQL
- Storage: On-chain metadata, IPFS optional

## 📁 Repository Structure (Coming Soon)

- `/contracts` – Smart contract code (Aiken / Plutus)
- `/frontend` – SvelteKit-based user interface
- `/backend` – API services and metadata indexing
- `/docs` – Developer and user documentation
